    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bulgogi is a beloved Korean dish that features thin slices of beef (often
      ribeye or sirloin) marinated in a savory-sweet mixture of soy sauce,
      sugar, garlic, sesame oil, and pear or apple for natural sweetness. The
      name "bulgogi" means "fire meat," a nod to its traditional preparation
      over an open flame or grill, although it's also commonly pan-fried. It's
      known for its tender texture, caramelized edges, and rich umami flavor
      with just a hint of sweetness.

    <p>
      Originating from Korea's Goguryeo era (circa 37 BCE), bulgogi has evolved
      from royal court cuisine to everyday comfort food. It became especially
      popular globally in the late 20th century as Korean food culture spread.
      Bulgogi is typically served with rice, lettuce leaves for wrapping, and a
      variety of banchan (side dishes), making it a balanced, satisfying meal.
