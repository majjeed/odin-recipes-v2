    <p>
      The cheeseburger is one of the most iconic American foods, combining a
      seasoned ground beef patty with a slice of melted cheese, served in a soft
      bun. Toppings like lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and condiments such
      as ketchup or mustard are often added. The flavor is rich, juicy, and
      savory, with the cheese adding a creamy, salty element that complements
      the beef.

      While hamburgers date back to the late 19th century, the cheeseburger rose
      to fame in the 1920s and 1930s in the U.S., with several diners and
      fast-food pioneers claiming credit for its invention. Today, it's a staple
      of American cuisine and has become a global symbol of comfort food and
      fast food culture.
