      Pad Thai is a stir-fried noodle dish that's widely recognized as
      Thailand's national dish. It features rice noodles saut√©ed with eggs, tofu
      or shrimp, bean sprouts, garlic, and peanuts, all tossed in a tangy,
      sweet-sour sauce made with tamarind paste, fish sauce, and palm sugar. The
      dish is often garnished with lime wedges and chili flakes, giving it a
      balance of salty, sweet, sour, and spicy flavors.

      Though it feels ancient, Pad Thai was actually popularized in the 1930s
      and 1940s as part of a nation-building campaign in Thailand. It was
      promoted as a cheap, nutritious street food and quickly became a favorite
      throughout the country. Today, Pad Thai is one of the most internationally
      beloved Thai dishes, prized for its complexity and vibrant flavor.
