      Peking Duck is a traditional Chinese dish known for its paper-thin, crispy
      skin and tender, flavorful meat. The duck is air-dried, glazed, and
      roasted until the skin becomes golden and crackling. It is typically
      served with thin pancakes, sliced scallions, cucumber, and hoisin sauce,
      allowing diners to assemble their own duck wraps.

      This dish dates back to the imperial era of the Yuan Dynasty (around the
      13th century) and gained legendary status during the Ming Dynasty.
      Originating from Beijing (formerly known as Peking), it remains one of
      China's most prestigious and ceremonial meals. Its rich, roasted aroma and
      indulgent flavor make it a standout on any menu.
