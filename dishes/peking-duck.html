    <p>
      Peking Duck is a traditional Chinese dish known for its paper-thin, crispy
      skin and tender, flavorful meat. The duck is air-dried, glazed, and
      roasted until the skin becomes golden and crackling. It is typically
      served with thin pancakes, sliced scallions, cucumber, and hoisin sauce,
      allowing diners to assemble their own duck wraps.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dish dates back to the imperial era of the Yuan Dynasty (around the
      13th century) and gained legendary status during the Ming Dynasty.
      Originating from Beijing (formerly known as Peking), it remains one of
      China's most prestigious and ceremonial meals. Its rich, roasted aroma and
      indulgent flavor make it a standout on any menu.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 whole duck (about 2-2.5kg)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp five-spice powder</li>
      <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tbsp honey or maltose syrup</li>
      <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Thin Mandarin pancakes (for serving)</li>
      <li>Hoisin sauce</li>
      <li>Thinly sliced scallions</li>
      <li>Thin cucumber sticks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Clean the duck and pat it dry. Prick the skin with a fork to help render
        fat during roasting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rub the duck with a mixture of five-spice powder, soy sauce, honey, and
        rice vinegar. Let it marinate uncovered in the fridge overnight to dry
        the skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast the duck in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 1.5 to 2
        hours, basting occasionally until the skin is crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the duck rest before slicing. Serve with pancakes, hoisin sauce,
        scallions, and cucumber.
      </li>
