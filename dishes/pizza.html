      Pizza, especially the classic Margherita, originates from Naples, Italy,
      where it started as a simple flatbread topped with tomatoes, mozzarella
      cheese, and fresh basil. The combination of chewy crust, rich tomato
      sauce, and creamy cheese makes for a balanced and universally loved flavor
      profile. The Margherita, with its red, white, and green colors, is said to
      have been created in 1889 in honor of Queen Margherita of Savoy.

      Though its roots are humble, pizza has become a global phenomenon, adapted
      in countless ways across cultures — from New York-style to deep-dish to
      gourmet varieties. Its versatility, affordability, and comforting taste
      have made it one of the most consumed dishes in the world.
