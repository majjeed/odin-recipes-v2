      Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup consisting of wheat noodles in a deeply
      flavored broth, often topped with sliced pork (chashu), soft-boiled egg,
      green onions, and nori (seaweed). There are several styles of broth —
      including shoyu (soy sauce), miso, tonkotsu (pork bone), and shio (salt) —
      each offering a different level of richness and depth. Ramen is known for
      its warm, comforting, umami-packed taste.

      Though ramen has Chinese origins, it was transformed and embraced in Japan
      throughout the 20th century, becoming a cultural staple. It gained massive
      popularity after World War II and even more so with the invention of
      instant ramen in the 1950s. Today, ramen shops are a staple in Japan and
      in cities around the world.
